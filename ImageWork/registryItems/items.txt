The trip is wet and wild and even includes a bit of horseback riding to the put-in point. Be forewarned: When the rains are heavy, the river swells and the trip can be somewhat harrowing.

Yet another option for fine dining and fusion cuisine, this small open-air restaurant has impressed me every time I've eaten here. When weather permits, more tables are set up under the trees in their beachfront garden area. Beautiful presentations and creative use of ingredients are the norm. The menu changes regularly, but the chefs always focus on using on the freshest and best ingredients available. One of the best options is the nightly tasting menu, which will feature anywhere from 5 to 7 courses, including dessert (which is always excellent here). The restaurant also has a good wine list, and they keep their bottles properly cool, to compensate for the often unforgiving heat of Guanacaste.
